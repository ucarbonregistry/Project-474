Innovators Infratech LLP (Project Proponent or PP) is the authorizer of Trimula Industries Limited.
Trimula Industries Limited is a structural steel manufacturer, has implemented a dedicated rainwater
harvesting system to address its significant water needs for operations such as cooling, power
generation, and steel production. Due to the absence of a nearby water source, the company
constructed a series of catchment ponds on-site to capture and utilize rainwater, reducing reliance on
groundwater and river resources (i.e. Bikul River). As the PP oversees the project activity, ensuring
effective rainwater runoff harvesting and proper maintenance of the catchment area during the
monsoon season. The PP also manages the necessary permits and documentation for water harvesting
and conservation activities, ensuring compliance and sustainability in its operations.
________________
The increasing pace of ground water extraction in agricultural, industrial and domestic sectors during
the past four decades has led to problems of continuously declining ground water levels and
deterioration of groundwater quality in many areas of Madhya Pradesh. This has threatened the
sustainability of many dug wells and tube wells. Depending heavily on agriculture-based economy, the
State requires assured irrigation for sustainable agricultural productivity. Groundwater is the major
source of irrigation, and also the sole source of drinking water. But the development of ground water is
constrained due to heterogeneity of the formations, non-uniformity in degree and nature of the
weathered and fractured zones of the aquifers. It is observed that there is heavy surface run-off in
many areas during the monsoon period often resulting in floods, yet these very same areas face crisis of
water during the summer. This flood- drought syndrome is basically resultant of improper management
of available water resources.

As ground water is an annually replenishable but limited resource, augmentation of the recharge to
ground water by the PP is the only option left for ensuring its sustainability.
This type of artificial recharge project activity helps to arrest the depletion of ground water resources on
the one hand and create additional resources to cater to the domestic, agricultural and industrial needs
in the State.
